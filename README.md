#price-compare
Website for comparing item prices between supermarkets.

Use Cases:
1. As a user, I want to be able to see the prices for a particular item so I know which supermarket has the item at the cheapest price
2. As a user, I want to be able to search for a particular item so that I can quickly find the item's price
3. As a user, I want to see the price trends of a particular item so that I know if the item actually got cheaper over a certain period of time e.g. 2 months.
4. As a user, I want to search items by category so that I can find a particular item e.g. toothbrush 
5. As a user, I don't want to see certain brands in my search so that I can avoid using their products due to reason such as bad experiences or bad brand values.
